Traditional A/B testing, while effective, often falls short in addressing the complexities and nuances of real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, a suite of advanced experimentation techniques has been developed, each offering unique insights and advantages.\n","\n","This report delves into six key advanced experimentation methods: Sequential Testing, Multi-Armed Bandits, Switchback Experiments, Stratified Sampling, Heterogeneous Effects Detection, and Experimental Meta-Analysis. Through detailed explanations and practical implementations using Python, we explore how these methods can be leveraged to enhance experimental accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.
