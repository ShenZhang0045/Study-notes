for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.\n","\n","The name \"Pandas\" has a reference to both \"Panel Data\", and \"Python Data Analysis\" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.\n","Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.\n","\n","Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.\n","\n","Relevant data is very important in data science.\n","\n","pandas\n","\n","Primary Purpose:\n","\n","pandas is designed for data manipulation and analysis, particularly for working with structured data.\n","It provides tools for data cleaning, preparation, and wrangling.\n","\n","Data Structures:\n","\n","The core data structures in pandas are Series (1-dimensional) and DataFrame (2-dimensional).\n","It supports heterogeneous data types (different columns in a DataFrame can be of different types).\n","\n","Functionality:\n","\n","pandas offers a wide range of functionalities for data manipulation, including data alignment, merging, reshaping, grouping, and time-series analysis.\n","It has powerful indexing and selection capabilities, allowing for more complex data manipulation tasks.\n","\n","Use Case:\n","\n","pandas is widely used in data analysis tasks such as data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.\n","It is particularly useful for handling missing data, filtering data, and performing operations on groups of data."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"8434a7a0","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"id":"8434a7a0"},"outputs":[],"source":["import
